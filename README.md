<h1>Wandering with Google Maps</h1>

**Note that you will need to add an API key for the solution code to run**.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Building apps with Google Maps allows you to add features to your app such as satellite imagery, robust UI controls for maps, location tracking, and location markers. You can add value to the standard Google Maps by showing information from your own data set, such as the locations of well-known fishing or climbing areas. You can also create games where the player explores the physical world, like a treasure hunt or the recent trend of augmented reality games.
In this lesson, you will create a Google Maps app called Wander that displays customized maps and shows the user's location.
